# open-here-extension
Opens something in current directory. Where something is, well, something in directory <My Document>/OpenHereContent. Could be anything: Word document, shortcut to folder, executable file, anything.

If shortcut is to be executed, see if it's 'Start In' property is set. If it is set, it would be respected, if it is empty, current directory will be used instead.
