# Open Here Shell Extension
Provides access to contents of predefined folder (My Documents\OpenHereContent) in folder/desktop context menu:
![Open Here extension in action](https://github.com/itsuart/open-here-extension/raw/master/img/visual%20description.jpg)
If shortcut is to be executed, see if it's 'Start In' property is set. If it is set, it would be respected, if it is empty, current directory will be used instead.

SHIFT-click to open item as administrator. Unfortunately working directory in such case no longer respected.

Navigate to Release tab to get prebuilt 64bit version of the extension.
